This is the *Minesweeper (Kotlin)* project I made myself.


<p>They say a minesweeper makes only two mistakes in their life: the first is their choice of occupation, and the second one is fatal. In this project, you will create your own, safe "Minesweeper" â€“ a game that will be a brain teaser for both you and your players.</p>
